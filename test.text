principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (per annum): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time (in years): "))


simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

print(f"Simple Interest = {simple_interest}")


now we will write a simple code for compund intrest!
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounds_per_year=1):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): Initial investment amount
        rate (float): Annual interest rate (decimal form, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
        time (float): Time period in years
        compounds_per_year (int): Number of times interest is compounded per year

lets write a code to make a simple game in python language
Here's a simple number guessing game in Python. Itâ€™s interactive, runs in the terminal, and gives you hints until you guess the right number:
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    guess = None
    attempts = 0
    while guess != number_to_guess:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))
            attempts += 1
	    if guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Too low! Try again.")
            elif guess > number_to_guess:
                print("Too high! Try again.")
